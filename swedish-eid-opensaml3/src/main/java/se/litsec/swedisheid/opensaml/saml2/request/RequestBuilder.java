 * A generic request builder that is used to create Request messages.

 * A request builder instance may only be used to create one request and should not be re-used. Instead a new builder
 * should be created using a builder factory.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default the request builder creates a Request object based on the SP and IdP settings in metadata and the
 * configuration of the builder factory, but it is also possible to control the request by using chaining calls as
 * illustrated below:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * RequestHttpObject request = builder.relayState("hello").binding("urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST").build();
